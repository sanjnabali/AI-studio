# TODO: Fix DropdownMenu Component Errors

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated DropdownMenu.vue to use defineComponent for better TypeScript support
- [x] Added proper slot definitions
- [x] Changed from <script setup> to traditional Vue 3 composition API
- [x] Verified that all errors are resolved in CodeCanvas.vue

## Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Test the dropdown functionality
- [ ] Ensure the component works correctly in the application

## Notes
- Changed DropdownMenu component from <script setup> to defineComponent to resolve TypeScript slot recognition issues
- The component now properly exports a Vue component with slots
